Smart Campus Navigation App using Android &amp; GPS
Campus Navigation System


Project Overview

Generally, the smart campus navigation system comes into picture

Basically, the smart navigation system that we have designed for our college campus in round 1 for the HACKATHON is used to eliminate what we called as a void or null in the institution navigation. It may sound dramatic, but the experience of getting lost within the boundaries of your campus and feeling extremely shy to ask directions around is genuinely frustrating, specially when it is the first day of the college. This problem really persists, new students often struggle finding their classrooms, hostels, mess, library, and other essential facilities in the college, existing navigation apps like Google or Apple maps only guide them to the main entrance of the campus, leaving them to figure out rest on their own.(Sometimes areas not recognised by google maps are greyed)
For any student, a campus is just like a small city within a larger city ,for him the smaller city is his college only. Without any doubt, Google maps work well for driving on public roads streets, but it performs poorly students need to locate a specific academic block while learning late for their classes. In the world, we called this issue as the last mile problem where the navigation fails at the very end of the journey, the application that we have built is built precisely to address these challenges. It focuses on to eliminate the directional anxiety of people making campus navigation simpler , more reliable, and stressfree.

Problem Statement: The Last-Mile Problem in Campuses

If you ever been lost in campus, you know it feels like a maze, and asking the guards or any local men inside the campus can be practical for the new students from India, but for the international students, they might find this headache for them to navigate and also some students are very shy to ask for directions. This happens because of the campus design they feel like amaze. They don’t grow in a straight line like a normal neighbourhood. They grow in a messy patches and they exist there for decades. It is quite normal for a newcomer to get lost in it.

Buildings in the campus are usually grouped by what they do like chemistry lab next to the chemistry class, make sense, but by numbers, they are quite different. They might be random, so guessing definitely don’t work here .The normal GPS will not provide you this level of concreteness and exactness. Also, there are some shortcuts in the campus path. The shortcuts might be used for hostel path or for any undergoing construction. Also, there are multiple buildings that uses the same red brick or grey concrete without landmarks. Our brain gets confused because all the corners in the campus looks exactly the same.


Limitations of Existing Navigation Apps

Now everybody asks why I cannot just use Google well, Google and Apple maps are made for trips like if you are going out trip and you don’t know the way so you can use Apple or Google maps for that, but since they aren’t made for the inside of any campus, that is, you cannot use Apple maps or Google maps to navigate inside of any campus because that’s a private area and Google or Apple is not allowed to do that.

Firstly, there is this grey box problem. That is if any area is not recognised by Google maps or Apple maps, so that area is completely grey i.e we can say there is nothing there. Secondly, big walls. They are really good at blocking GPS signals so any time standard apps can lag or freeze once you step inside of any big building .And yes these big apps don’t work for our campus because they are not specialised for that only. But our app is specifically made for our campus and recognise our campus. Navigation becomes way more easier.


Project Vision and Core Goals

So the main goal behind building this app for personal navigator of the campus. We want to make the campus roads, less confusion and we want this app to be your personal navigator so that you can freely explore your new campus.

We are focusing on three big things here:

1.Independence: using this app, you will be free from any foundation of asking directions. You will yourself find it very exciting to explore the whole campus.
2.being exact: this app will only be able to navigate you inside the campus. It won't be working outside, and it will be very exact to where you are inside the campus.
3.smoothness: since this app is focused only inside the campus, it will be very precise and very accurate. We will be trying our best to make it more scalable and user-friendly.


Features Implemented (Round One)

Talking about its feature, we don’t just put in stuff to look cool every part of this app as a real job to do for the user.

Now, this is the submission for the round one hackathon and we are not physically present in the campus. What we have done in this app is, we have made a custom app of our campus and based on the GPS services, we calculate the longitude and latitude with respect to our campus and even if we are not present in the campus, the location pointer still allow us to vendor inside of the campus in the app.

For round two we’ll be trying to make it more accurate and add more features that will be discussed ahead, but for now, we have added these features.

Smart layer: we have used location services as such that it is very optimum for your battery life of your phone, and also it provide accurate location.
Custom map graphics: we have used a hardcoded map of our campus. Since we are not present in the campus, this makes the project by flexible as well as we can add any campus map so that not only graphic era but any campus In the world, can use our services.
Live tracking: we have this location pointer, which shows you exactly where you are(for round one, it’s random because we are not physically present at campus). And when you move around, the pointer, will also follow you.


Target Users

Now talking about, who is supposed to use this, so anyone who is new to the campus, example like new students, their parents ,visitors or the international students. This can be used for the workers as well who are near the campus who just started their things in the campus. The design is minimal, it will be easy for every kind of person to use it.


Platform Choice

Right now, this project app works only on android as right now we are all in the android world. Also, most of the students in the campus. They usually have android. And currently, this app is not for iOS, but surely in the future advancement or for the round two, we will definitely try to land it on the iOS platform as well.

We think that the android gives us more flexibility in design designing or modifying the app, then the iOS also the sensor access. The GPS chips is more talkative in android than iPhones. So that is the wholesome reason we chose android.


User Journey

Journey of this app will be very smooth. You will just open the app and it will ask you for your location permissions and then your phone. GPS will warm up in the background and when the app will be ready, you will be seeing a start navigation. Button and if it is clicked, then navigation starts the map fills the whole screen and start showing you where you are in real time.

You will get constant updates while you walk, so you can know where you are, and this feels like someone is working with you.


Current Limitations and Planned UI Work

We will be working more on the UI of our app in the round two, because in around one, we have to just show the prototype button round to, we will be working on the smart AI assistant navigation part also, and further more future scopes will be listed ahead.


Use Cases by User Type

Students

The campus navigation system is designed as an institutive mobile application that helps students, visitors and faculty in a in the campus

Students
Daily navigation to the classrooms and different lecture hall and different class rooms becomes a difficult task in a college. There are many lectures, many classrooms and Student find it difficult to find the classroom. When there is a change in classroom by a faculty, so don’t find it difficult to find the room or the classroom.

So, our system has A built in offline map and low data design that helps Even when cellular networks are congested so it will beneficial for the students. And it is highly benefited for the students of first year, or new students, or Students that came for some Campus participation So it is highly Important for Them.

For campuses it is difficult for Student to find the desired classroom library lecture hall and faculty office etc. So, our system will help in daily navigation between lecture halls, hostel library, finding faculty officers Discovering available study spaces and it will be highly Useful during exam times There our exam is scheduled in different classes that are not known to us and by the help of our navigation system campus navigation system we can find our Exam Hall during our exams.

Visitors

Visitors
Usefulness of Our campus navigation system for visitors. It is highly useful for visitors, as it has a visitor mode with minimal ui steps and audio directions. It is useful for parents’ External attendees. And prospective students who are keen for campus tour

It helps them to guide admission office, guest house, auditorium, Hostel, Mess, Departmental store, Canteen and parking guides.

Faculty & Staff

Faculty & Staff
Our campus navigation system has features for the faculty and the staff members. For the faculty members they are moving from Different classes, so it will be helpful for them to manage the classes and access department context quickly and Mark restricted areas like lab, which can be under maintenance

It can be helpful for staff members also. To get that real time staff location Monitoring Route planning an incident reporting with existing campus features and facilities This campus navigation system. Can provide a very great value and help in digitalizing. Our campus.

It has gps Two pixel anchoring that ensures precise Monitoring Precise and stable replacement, even indoors, where gps signals are weak


Real World Applications

This application that we have built is a gold for the newcomers who are new to this campus, they may be students or even faculties, that are new to the campus. Since it takes some time to indulge into the campus environment and its routes . So you can make our app as your companion to explore the campus. There will be various new features that will be added to this app such as you can order from the canteen online using our app. And in one section of the app and there will be the weekly campus news.

Hackathon Relevance

Hackathon Relevance

The project is apt for this hackathon as demonstrates poor, technical and UX innovation, it has map appointed and a touch to zoom and pan to map feature with live demo and source code. It is lightweight and if we can see any future advancement, we can add them quickly in this project. We want to make it more accessible and useful for the campus students ,teachers and staff members.


Scalability from a UX Perspective

Scalability from a UX Perspective

Users are those using the app, so their experience rely on how good the app performs for which we will be focusing on some scaling strategies-

These strategies for scaling include:
Search and Filters: include smart search feature for searching any particular location inside of the campus.
Performance optimization: Google’s fused location service provider consumes less battery and provides accurate data.
Accessibility. Will be made multilingual, so that international students can also access in their language.
Making this an all rounder campus usage app will be on priority.



Future UI Improvements

Future UI Improvements
To improve the use of our Campus navigation system. We could do some improvement Like :

Smooth animation
Offline search indexing
Routing guidance
GPS and map alignment
A Mascot

Current UI Limitations

Limited background handling and battery optimization.
No tool for admin to push new map update.



Advantages Over Google Maps

Advantages Over Google Maps

It's way more useful than Google maps because they are basically designed for navigation in roads or streets, not inside the periphery of any campus or any private property. So our app is slightly integrated within the campus boundaries which includes its timetable booking, emergency, contact and everything. Additionally, it is completely add free with minimal UI which is currently focused only on the campus navigation system.



App Demo Guide

App Demo Guide
This is our campus navigation prototype for our campus. It is optimised for better working navigation

When opened it shows the screen and a button that says start navigation.
Enable or stimulate location so the live pointer and stable updates.
Demonstrate pinch-zoom and pan highlight the pointers accuracy.
Explain offline rational map GPS multiplier.

We have built a lightweight yet an extendable prototype ready for full deployment.


Screens Overview (Layout Diagrams Referenced)

Screens Overview with layout Diagrams

1.User Screen
Initial loading of Campus navigation system.

2.Dashboard
Shows up a screen which says START NAVIGATION

3.Map Screen
This is our main interaction screen where pointer zoom gestures take place.

4.POI info
It shows building information and location information with quick actions.


UI Design Philosophy

Summary of UI Design Philosophy
The app UI has many good features Such as minimal layout, precision, offline support, progressive complexity, voice support and accessibility.


Dashboard & Assistant (Planned)

In this app, we will be also showing a dashboard screen. Currently it is not in intact, but we will be showing it.

In the second round, we are deciding to make an AI assistant navigation system in a app, and also we have decided to include a mascot of our app so that it can interact with the user.


Technical Implementation Overview

This app is built on the android platform using Kotlin, which is Google’s officially recommended language for the android development and for accessing users location, we have used Google fused location provider.

The static map is pinch to zoom and track to pen implementation done using the android matrix transformation.

The first GPS location is treated as the reference point (which random) and all the further movement is calculated with respect to it.

Further the location pointer is map anchored, not screen anchored.


Future Scope (Round Two Vision)

In round two, we aim to expand this into a complete smart campus platform.

1.since there are the facilities in campus like bakery and canteen, so this app can support online ordering from campus facilities.
2.we also plan to intertrait AI based building and a identification.
3.overall, we are planning to build a full AI based navigation system on our app.
